# CYBR 8480 Project Milestone 2: Prototype development
**Assigned: Tuesday 3/27/18**

## Due Date
Tuesday April 17th (4/17/17) by class time, Presentation and Demo 4/17/17.

## Overview
This project milestone tasks you with building a prototype application that addresses your top user stories. This means you will be creating features to support and realize your user stories. The milestone also tasks you with generating relevant documentation associated with design and implementation of your app. Towards this goal, you will be required to submit the following by the due date:

* [User story realization](#user-story-realization) - Document and describe what was done.
  - Identify tasks achieved in this product increment
  - Bind tasks, code artifacts, and documentation together
* [Presentation](#presentation) - Demo and discuss your milestone 2 work with Dr. Hale and the class

**All materials will be submitted on GitHub, be sure to post your slides and a link to your GitHub Repo on canvas.**

## User story realization
In this milestone, you will focus on drilling into actually realizing (i.e. completing) your user stories. This means actually start coding and working to develop the features to support the stories. As you do this, keep basic documentation to connect your work to the ideas that created it. Make sure to update your architectural diagrams if anything changes from your design.

### Submission materials
You should prepare a prototype application/product that demonstrates the three selected user stories. The prototype should include an IoT component and a mobile app. The app may be hybrid or native. The IoT component should use Bluetooth or another wireless protocol (such as RFID or Wi-Fi) to communicate. All code should be properly documented - with non-trivial code (such as methods and algorithms) briefly explained in-line using appropriate comments. Update your component descriptions associated with the architecture diagram with appropriate references in the code (where applicable). The last element of submission materials include a demo-ready compiled app that can demonstrate some basic functionality.

### Grading Criteria
Your will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (33-40) | Some Issues (25-32) | Does not meet expectations (0-24) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Effort and progress | It is clear that the individual/team has made non-trivial effort and progress towards user story realization.| There is some evidence of effort and progress, but more could have been done in the time. | Little effort or progress was made towards user story realization.|
| Documentation | Code artifacts and tasks are documented well. Documentation is clear and illustrative. | Some code is documented, but large portions are not. | Little or no documentation.|
| Prototype Demo | The product is successfully demoed for Dr. Hale and the class. The individual/team addresses and handles questions well. | The demo partially works, but there are some significant issues. | Many significant issues or non-functional prototype.|

**Total 120 points.**

## Presentation
You will be expected to present your Milestone 2 achievements to the class on the submission day. It is important that you use this time to both inform your classmates of your activities and to get feedback. You will be expected to demo your prototype product.

### Submission Materials
Submit your slides to Dr. Hale by class time on the day of the presentation. Submit them via canvas.

### Grading Criteria
Your presentation will be graded using the following rubric:

| | Meets expectations (9-10) | Some Issues (6-8) | Does not meet expectations (0-5)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Enthusiasm and clarity | Presenter exhibits enthusiasm about the work and speaks clearly and confidently. | Some issues with clarity and enthusiasm. | Presenter has mumbles, is not clear, and/or does not demonstrate any enthusiasm. |
| Understanding of product | Presenter understands all aspects presented about the project. | Some gaps in understanding when questioned by audience or routinely looks at team slides |Poor understanding of project. |
| Relevant information | Engaging relevant information is presented about the project. | Valuable information is presented but there are multiple tangents. | Little valuable information is presented |
| Explain high level goal(s) | Overall goals are briefly recapped. | Too much time is spend on the goals | Way too much time is spent or goals are not covered at all. |
| Explain user stories | User stories are quickly re-capped. | Too much time is spent reading off user stories | Way to much time spent or no coverage at all. |
| Explain architecture | Overall architecture is briefly discussed in terms of important components. | Too much time is spent on the architecture. | Way too much time is spent or no coverage of architecture. |


| | Meets expectations (17-20) | Some Issues (10-16) | Does not meet expectations (0-9)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Demo* | Deliverable is demonstrated with accompanied explanation of outcomes and success. Product functionality is successfully demoed. | Demo is mildly successful. | Demo fails or is not included in the presentation |

> `*` Note that Demos may include videos if the conditions necessary to replicate the demo cannot be re-created in a live in-class demo.

**Total 80 points.**
