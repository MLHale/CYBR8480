# CYBR 8480 Project Milestone 2: Prototype development
**Assigned: Wednesday 3/27/19**

## Due Date
Tuesday April 17th (4/17/19) by class time, Demo with Dr. Hale 4/17/19.

## Points
120 Project points (15% of overall grade), 40 Participation Points

## Overview
This project milestone tasks you with building a prototype application that addresses your top user stories. This means you will be creating features to support and realize your user stories. The milestone also tasks you with generating relevant documentation associated with design and implementation of your app. Towards this goal, you will be required to submit the following by the due date:

* [User story realization](#user-story-realization) - Document and describe what was done.
  - Identify tasks achieved in this product increment
  - Bind tasks, code artifacts, and documentation together
* [Demo](#demo) - Demo and discuss your milestone 2 work with Dr. Hale 

**All materials will be submitted on GitHub, be sure to post your slides and a link to your GitHub Repo on canvas.**

## User story realization
In this milestone, you will focus on drilling into actually realizing (i.e. completing) your user stories. This means actually start coding and working to develop the features to support the stories. As you do this, keep basic documentation to connect your work to the ideas that created it. Make sure to update your architectural diagrams if anything changes from your design.

### Submission materials
You should prepare a prototype application/product that demonstrates the three selected user stories. The prototype should include an IoT component and a mobile app. The app may be hybrid or native. The IoT component should use Bluetooth or another wireless protocol (such as RFID or Wi-Fi) to communicate. All code should be properly documented - with non-trivial code (such as methods and algorithms) briefly explained in-line using appropriate comments. Update your component descriptions associated with the architecture diagram with appropriate references in the code (where applicable). The last element of submission materials include a demo-ready compiled app that can demonstrate some basic functionality.

### Grading Criteria
Your will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (33-40) | Some Issues (25-32) | Does not meet expectations (0-24) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Effort and progress | It is clear that the individual/team has made non-trivial effort and progress towards user story realization.| There is some evidence of effort and progress, but more could have been done in the time. | Little effort or progress was made towards user story realization.|
| Documentation | Code artifacts and tasks are documented well. Documentation is clear and illustrative. | Some code is documented, but large portions are not. | Little or no documentation.|
| Outcomes | The product has clear outcomes delivered in this milestone. | Some outcomes are clear | Many significant issues or non-functional prototype.|


> `*` Note that Demos may include videos if the conditions necessary to replicate the demo cannot be re-created in a live in-class demo.

**Total 120 points.**

## Demo (Participation)
You must demo your app for Dr. Hale. You should show off the features you've realized so far, as well as speak to the current design problems you are encountering and how you will surmount them.

| | Meets expectations (33-40) | Some Issues (25-32) | Does not meet expectations (0-24) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prototype Demo* | The product is successfully demoed for Dr. Hale and the class. The individual/team addresses and handles questions well. | The demo partially works, but there are some significant issues. | Many significant issues or non-functional prototype.|
